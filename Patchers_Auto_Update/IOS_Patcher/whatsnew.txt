1.9.1 [2020/10/29]
The time has come. Support for this piece of software has officially ended.
It received a last update over 2 years ago and since then has been replaced by RiiConnect24 Patcher which is an All-In-One patcher that has all of the IOS Patcher functionality and much more.

Nothing lasts forever, we have to move forward.
Thank you very much for using the patcher. Take care :)
