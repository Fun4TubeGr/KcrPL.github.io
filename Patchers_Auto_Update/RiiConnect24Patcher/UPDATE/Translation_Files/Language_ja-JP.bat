set string438=Did you know the wii was the best selling game-console of 2006?
set string439=Did you know KcrPL makes these amazing patchers?
set string440=RiiConnect24 originally started out as "CustomConnect24"!
set string441=Did you the RiiConnect24 logo was made by NeoRame, the same person who made the Wiimmfi logo?
set string442=The Wii was nicknamed "Revolution" during its development stage.
set string443=Did you know the letters in the Wii model number RVL stand for the Wii's codename, Revolution?
set string444=The music used in many of the Wii's channels (including the Wii Shop, Mii, Check Mii Out, and Forecast Channel) was composed by Kazumi Totaka.
set string445=The Internet Channel once costed 500 Wii Points.
set string446=It's possible to use candles as a Wii Sensor Bar.

set string452=The Everybody Votes Channel was originally an idea about sending quizzes and questions daily to Wiis.
set string453=The News Channel developers had an idea at some point about making a dad's Mii being the news caster in the Channel, but it probably didn't make it because some stories on there probably aren't appropriate for kids.
