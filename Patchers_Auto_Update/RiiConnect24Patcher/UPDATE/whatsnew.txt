1.3.1
- Added error reporting. Errors will be now automatically reported to the server.
- Fixed an issue when IOS31 and IOS80 didn't have all the patches applied.
- Fixed few issues in the script.

1.3.0
It's about time for another big update! This time we're localising the patcher so everyone can use it!
- Added translations. You can now select your own language.
- Fixed a LOT of bugs. Not even gonna post a list of them here.
- Added support for running the patcher in Windows PE.

While this doesn't sound like there was a lot of work, the patcher went through a lot of testing on the beta branch - while keeping stable branch working for people that still wanted to get RiiConnect24.
On the start, we support 10 languages. English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish and Swedish. More languages are coming! I hope everyone will find this update useful. This also introduced a lot of bugs which took a lot of time to debug. However, I feel that it's stable enough to be released to stable branch.
If you want to help with translations, you can join the translation project here - https://crowdin.com/project/riiconnect24-patcher

This time, translations are implemented a lot better than my implementation of it 2 years ago in the IOS Patcher. The translations will now always stay up to date thanks to the patcher always fetching the translation file from servers instead of updating the program. 

This is a big update - please make sure to report any bugs to me and I'll try to fix them ASAP! If there will be critical bugs, I'll even consider returning to previous stable version (`however, I'll do everything to avoid this`).

Thank you for using RiiConnect24 Patcher. It took me and the translation team a lot of time and effort to get this working.
We hope you'll like this update.
