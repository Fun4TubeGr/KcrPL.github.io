1.2.0
Went trough BETA testing from our community on Discord!
- You can now patch RiiConnect24 Wii U and Dolphin.
- A lot of bug fixes with curl and more.
- The patcher will now delete WAD folder before it starts patching. It's a brick prevention for our users.
- Files created by the patcher will now have more details in their file name (for example, for Wii only, region etc.)
- Fixed crashes

When patching the file for Wii U, it will make a backup of it and will pack it to a .ZIP, don't delete that file until you're sure that everything works.
It's a really big update! I hope nothing will break... but if it does - contact me!

1.1.3
- Changed our update system to be more flexible.
- Once and for all, fixed all updating problems.
NOTE: All previous versions of patchers should migrate to new style of updating without any issues. If not, download manually from GitHub.
- Added a check so the patcher can tell if NUS is up or down.
- Got rid of the announcement network.

1.1.2.3
