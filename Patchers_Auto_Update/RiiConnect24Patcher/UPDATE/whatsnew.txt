1.2.2
- Made patching process a little quicker.
- You can now install WAD channels directly to the SD Card itself! You can now install 150 channels in few minutes. The patcher will guide you through the entire process!
	> All thanks to DarkMatterCore!
- The "Homebrew Shop" will now check if the specified app is on the server faster.

1.2.1
- Added a note that you can't have any themes applied to your vWii if you want to apply the 4:3 black bars patch.
- Integrated Open Shop Channel (https://oscwii.org/) to RiiConnect24 Patcher. You can visit it under the "Visit Homebrew Shop" option. It can also automatically install homebrew to your Wii's SD Card!
- Improvements to Wiimmfi Patchers.

1.2.0
Went trough BETA testing from our community on Discord!
- You can now patch RiiConnect24 Wii U and Dolphin.
- A lot of bug fixes with curl and more.
- The patcher will now delete WAD folder before it starts patching. It's a brick prevention for our users.
- Files created by the patcher will now have more details in their file name (for example, for Wii only, region etc.)
- Fixed crashes

When patching the file for Wii U, it will make a backup of it and will pack it to a .ZIP, don't delete that file until you're sure that everything works.
It's a really big update! I hope nothing will break... but if it does - contact me!
