Hi! This is a developement status for the RiiConnect24:

Currently working on: Nintendo Channel

Good news - the guy who made a tool back in the day for the Nintendo Channel (yellows8) just gave me a TON of nintendo channel files, per my request on IRC. That means, we can start prioritizing the Channel!
Currently the channel does load and go to menu. We got more progress on getting things to load.

"Wow, the progress of getting stuff to load on the Nintendo Channel has been happening fast! I just got the DS download to work. We have been listening to y'all about wanting homebrew on it. (Yes, the game loaded.)"

Please use option 2, 3 and 4 to open images showcasing the progress on loading the channel.

1. Go back to main menu
2. Open Image 1
3. Open Image 2
4. Open Image 3
